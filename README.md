# Work Day Schedule Planner

This is an easy to use daily planner made using a prewritten html and css file that was provided. The current day and date for the daily planner is displayed at the top in the header.

## How to Use

Rows for the hours of 9AM-5PM are built in html. Each row is able to save text (work day events ie. meetings, calls) and the text is saved to local storage so that when refreshed the text in the schedule for any hour still remains. As the day progresses and time passes, the time slots in the past will be altered to a gray color. The present time will be red and the future time will be green as provided in the css file.
